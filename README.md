# Countdown-Math
Two player arithmetic math game

CountDownMath Game in C++ This C++ project implements a Countdown-style game where players use arithmetic operations to reach a randomly generated target number. The game challenges players by providing a set of random numbers and an arithmetic target, and they must perform different operations to reach the target.

Features Random Number Generation: Generates a random set of numbers and a target number for each round. Arithmetic Challenge: Players can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the target. Recursive Pathfinding Algorithm: A recursive algorithm automatically calculates the sequence of operations needed to reach the target, and prints the calculations for the users to see. Scalable Design: The game is designed to be easily extendable, allowing future additions such as difficulty levels or new operations.
